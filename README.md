- Recently, I worked on creating a few product-style creative posts, and this time my approach was not random designing I followed a proper inspiration → planning → creation workflow, just like real marketing teams do.
- The first step of my process always starts with Instagram📱. I explored different skincare, beauty, and lifestyle brand pages to understand what kind of visuals actually stop people from scrolling. From there, I observed patterns like minimal backgrounds, soft shadows, clean product focus, and calm color tones. That helped me decide what type of mood and style I wanted for my own creatives🎯.
- After that, I moved to Pinterest to study product photography concepts and compositions. I searched for things like skincare product shoots, studio lighting ideas, shelf-style product setups, and spa-themed compositions. Pinterest really helped me understand how brands place products, how shadows are used, and how background shapes and textures create a premium feel. This step helped me visualize exactly how my final image should look👀✨.
- Once the concept was clear in my mind, I used ChatGPT to help me convert my visual ideas into proper AI prompts. I focused on details like lighting direction, background style, color tones, product positioning, and overall mood. Writing the right prompt made a big difference in getting realistic and professional-looking results✍️💡.
- Then I used Gemini AI to actually generate the images based on those prompts. I didn’t just generate once and accept the result I refined the prompts multiple times to improve shadows, product focus, background depth, and overall aesthetics until the visuals looked close to real product photography🎥📸.
- While finalizing the creatives, I also kept Instagram post format in mind, making sure the images are suitable for square layout, clean framing, and social-media-friendly composition so that they can be used for brand posts or ads📲.
- Through this process, I learned that AI does not replace creativity it supports it. The final quality of the image depends on how well we understand brand style, visual storytelling, and audience psychology. Tools can generate images, but the idea, direction, and refinement still come from the creator🎨🧠.
  
- This small project helped me improve my skills in:
- ✨ visual content planning,
- 🎨 brand-style creative thinking,
- ✍️ prompt writing for AI tools,
- 📱 and social-media-focused design.
- It was a great experience of combining Instagram trend analysis + Pinterest visual research + AI-powered creation to produce marketing-ready creatives🚀.

Still learning, still experimenting, and enjoying the creative process 🚀✨
